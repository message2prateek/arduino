# Arduino Code Club

The purpose of this Code Club exercise to is get kids excited about Coding, Electronics and Technology. The material aims at providing kids with exerices which they can completed in a 4 hour workshop and take away with them working project which they could demonstrate to their family and friends.

This exercise is inspired by [Blink Master](https://www.hackster.io/rmbyers/blink-master-78aa7a) by [Rick Byers](rickb@rbyers.net) 

## Introduction to Arduino
Adruino is a microcontroller. A microcontroller is a small computer but multiple magnitudes less powerful as compared to a typical computer. Arduino excels at performing small tasks using a small amount of power(electricity) very reliably.  

## Basic concepts of Electricity

### Electricity 
Electricity is described as the rate of flow of charge. It is measured measured using a unit called Ampere (A).

### Resistance
A resistor or resistance, resist the flow of electricity. The larger the value of the resistor the less
