## Arduino Musings

These are my Arduino sketches I have written through my journey into the world of microcontrollers.

### Tools of trade
1. [Arduino Uno](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-uno-rev3)
2. [PlatformIO](http://platformio.org/platformio-ide) plugin for Atom
3. [AutoDesk Curcuits](https://circuits.io/) for prototyping and simulating circuits
4. Fritzing(http://fritzing.org/home/)

### Why PlatformIO?
Arduino IDE is an awesome piece of software, but I have chosen to use PlatformIO as it provides some key features which I am quite used to as a software tester in my full time job.

These features are -
- Code completion, even for private libraries
- Smart linting
- A proper debugger
- Code formatting with Atom Beautify and Uncrustify

I hope to see these features come to Arduino IDE soon.
